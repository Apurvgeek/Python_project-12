Speech Emotion Recognition, abbreviated as SER, is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion.
SER is tough because emotions are subjective and annotating audio is challenging.

Prerequisites
You’ll need to install the following libraries with pip:
pip install librosa soundfile numpy sklearn pyaudio

Speech Emotion Recognition – Objective
To build a model to recognize emotion from speech using the librosa and sklearn libraries and the RAVDESS dataset.
